## 🚨 IMPORTANT: FOUNDATIONAL PROJECT NOTICE

> ⚠️ This is a BASE-LEVEL foundational project designed to connect the GoHighLevel community with AI automation through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

### 🎯 What This Project Is:

- **Foundation Layer**: This project provides access to all sub-account level GoHighLevel API endpoints via MCP. It acts as a bridge between the GoHighLevel platform and various AI automation tools, making integration smoother and more efficient.

- **Community Starter**: Built to foster collaboration within the GoHighLevel community, this project aims to accelerate progress and innovation. By sharing resources and knowledge, we can move forward together.

- **Open Architecture**: The design of this project allows for modularization. API clients and types can be segmented and customized to meet specific needs. This flexibility enables developers to tailor their implementations effectively.

- **Educational Resource**: This project serves as a learning tool for those interested in integrating GoHighLevel with AI systems. It provides practical examples and documentation to help users understand the integration process.

### ⚠️ Critical AI Safety Considerations:

- **Memory/Recall Systems**: Implementing proper memory or recall mechanisms is essential. Without them, AI may perform unintended actions, leading to potential issues. Ensure that your systems are designed to handle memory appropriately.

- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API usage to avoid exceeding GoHighLevel's rate limits. Monitoring your API calls will help maintain the stability of your applications.

- **Permission Controls**: This project provides full access to your sub-account APIs. It is crucial to understand the implications of this access and to implement necessary permission controls to safeguard your data.

- **Data Security**: All actions performed through this project are executed with your credentials. Ensure that you follow best practices for data security to protect sensitive information.

### Usage

To use the GoHighLevel MCP Server, you can make API calls using the provided endpoints. Here’s a simple example of how to fetch data from a sub-account:

```javascript
const { GoHighLevelAPI } = require('./api');

const api = new GoHighLevelAPI('YOUR_API_KEY');

api.getSubAccountData('SUB_ACCOUNT_ID')
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```
